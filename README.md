# Birthday card for [Kelly](https://kellyoconnor.carbonmade.com/)

This is very simple Flask app that loads random images from Google's LIFE Magazine archives 
and displays them with CSS3 pattern overlays. It uses Google's Custom Search Engine API to
locate images. 

In order to use this, you need to get a Google Developer Key and create a custom search engine.

Live version here (at least for now): http://kelly.saharagray.com
